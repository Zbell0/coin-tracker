# react-learning

This repository documents my journey of learning React and modern front-end development practices. It includes small experiments and practical implementations using tools like **styled-components**, **TypeScript**, **React hooks**, and **ThemeProvider**.

I created this space to explore and solidify core concepts such as component styling, animations, form handling, theme integration, and type-safe design patterns in React. Each commit in this project corresponds to a new concept or technique I've studied, starting from basic styled components to more advanced usage like keyframes animations, theme extension, and typed props.

## Topics Covered

- Styled-components fundamentals (props, .attrs, polymorphism)
- CSS animations using keyframes
- React forms with controlled inputs
- ThemeProvider and dynamic theming (light/dark mode)
- TypeScript integration with styled-components
- Declaration merging to extend theme types

## Tech Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- styled-components
